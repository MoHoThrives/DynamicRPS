# Rock Paper Scissor V2
Unlike the first version, this one is more interactive and uses the DOM manipulation. For the user, it's a GUI interface instead of a command line.

## Things I learned
- A more straightforward way of selecting elements using CSS rules for selectors.

## Things I should keep in mind next time
- Keeping code organized, by knowing what to make a global variable and what to make a local variable, and to place the global variable at top.
- Put the methods in order of abstraction, the more abstract, the higher it should be at the top.
- Make the methods more modular so I wouldn't have to write some things over and over again.
